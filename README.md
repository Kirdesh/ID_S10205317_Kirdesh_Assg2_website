# Your Project's Name

The project is called exploring space. what you can do in this webpage is that a user can open it in a window and the first thing that will pop up is the image of the day with explanation to the images.
Everyday at 1300hrs(SGT) there will be a new image that goes up on the webpage. These images that go up on the webpage are increadible. Users can learn what the imagees mean and if they want to they can
download the image to maybe set as their wallpaper or just save it for next time. Not only that, when the user scrolls down the webpage they will see an Astroid tracker. At that portion, the user can choose
a date and from there, the programme will pull data from the Nasa API and share it with the user. The user can learn a lot about the meteor like the Id, Name, wheather it is dangerous or not, the Magnitude, 
estimated minimum diametere, estimated maximun diametere, distance from earth and the date when it will be the closest to earth.
 
## Design Process
 
The webpage is for people who either are intrested in space or people wants to know more a space or people who love data.
This will help people who want to know more about space because they get an information everyday. thus, they will not be overwhelmed and get either bored or scared of space.
And for the people who already love space or love data, they can either learn more from the daily picture update or they can go the distance and look at the astroid data which is pretty interesting.


- As a beginner to space knowledge, i want to look at a picture and get information about the picture, so that i can learn more about space.
- As a person who loves space, i want to have more precise and unique information, so that expand my knowledge



## Features

-There is a daily picture update with explanation, title and date of the picture.

-There is an astroid tracker which gives people data on discovered astroids 
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - once a user comes into the webpage there will be a picture with an explanation, title and date attached to it

- Feature 2 - users choose a date and the data for discovered astroids appear

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- I want to implement more Nasa API in to the webpage like the searching through nasa's image and video database, pictures of the surface of mars, weather of mars and many more 

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    - helped in creating some of the code in the webpage

- [materializecss](https://materializecss.com/)
    - most of the css was achieved by this websites help. 

-[NASA.api](https://api.nasa.gov/)
    - all of the data is taken from this website

-[Java.script](https://www.javascript.com/)
    - the webpage uses java script for the api and the pop up calendar

## Testing

1. Daily Photo update:
    1. I need to see if the picture pops up when i enter the webpage
    2. reload the page and see if the same picture is still there
    3. wait 24 hours and see if the image changed
    4. redo this proccess until submission day to make sure that the pictures changes and does not cycle

2. Astroid Tracker:
    1. click on the choose a date option make sure the calendar pops up
    2. once clicking on a date the pop up should go away
    3. the correct data of the astroids are shown correctly

The webpage will change its size according to the display size.

Bugs - The astroid data is popping up a bit late however, i think that it is just a result of how much data it has to pull from the api and transfer it to the webpage.
